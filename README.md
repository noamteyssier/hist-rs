# hist

A high-throughput CLI to count unique lines.

This is a standalone tool with equivalent functionality to `| sort | uniq -c | sort -n`.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install hist-rs
```

## Usage

```bash
# count unique lines in a file
hist <file>

# count unique lines from stdin
/bin/cat <file> | hist

# skip counting and just write unique lines
hist <file> -u

# exclude lines matching a pattern while counting
hist <file> -e <pattern>

# include lines matching a pattern while counting
hist <file> -i <pattern>

# only output lines with abundance greater than or equal to a threshold
hist <file> -m <threshold>

# only output lines with abundance less than or equal to a threshold
hist <file> -M <threshold>

# sort output by the key (default: by abundance)
hist <file> -n

# sort output in descending order (default: ascending)
hist <file> -d
```
